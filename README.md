## Introduction

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced developers. The use of design patterns promotes code reusability, maintainability, and scalability.

This repository focuses on design patterns in Java, one of the most popular programming languages. It provides detailed explanations, code examples, and practical applications for each pattern.

## Design Patterns

Design patterns are categorized into three main groups:

### Creational Patterns

### Structural Patterns

### Behavioral Patterns
1. **Memento Pattern**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
2. **State Pattern**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
3. **Iterator Pattern**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

## Usage

To use the design patterns provided in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine. Each design pattern is organized into its own directory, containing Java source code, explanations, and examples.
